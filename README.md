<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Android app using JikanAPI, which shows upcoming anime. App was written in Kotlin. It was a training to get familiar with MVVM pattern with Clean Architecture.
It has two screens, one shows upcoming anime list, where user can look up new anime, click on the image to open MyAnimeList page and save anime to favourites.
Second screen shows previously saved anime. User is still able to open MAL webpage and remove anime from list.


### What I Used

* [Retrofit](https://github.com/square/retrofit) (api requests)
* [Room database](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room) (saving anime to avoid constant api requests)
* [DaggerHilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/) (dependency injection)
* [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide) (loading images)
* [Paging](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging/v3-overview) (loading anime into recyclerview)
* [Custom Tabs](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/android/custom-tabs/overview/) (opening MAL web page)
